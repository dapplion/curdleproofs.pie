# curdleproofpie

curdleproofpie is a Python equivalent to [curdleproofs](https://github.com/asn-d6/curdleproofs) original implementation along with a python Merlin transcript implementation.

All tests pass for equivalency to the original curdleproofs Rust implementation as well as Merlin transcript conformance to Strobe.
